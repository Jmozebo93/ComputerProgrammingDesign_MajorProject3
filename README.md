COMP167 Major Programming Assignment3 
Spring 2021
Introduction
This assignment requires you to create a Java application that implements a scientific calculator. 

 
Basic Functionalities
Students will develop following basic functionalities as part of this step:
	Layout Design
	Input text field
	Output text field
	Numbers from 0 to 9
	Buttons (+,-,*,/,%,=)
Event Listeners for Basic Functionalities
As part of this step, students should work on implementing action listeners for the buttons created in step 2. Input text field should show the input provided by the user and output text field should show the result.
Data Buttons and Functionalities
Students will develop following buttons and their event listeners as part of this step:
	Power Buttons (x2, x3)
	Modulus Button (Mod)
	Data Manipulation Buttons (1/n, âˆšx)
	Log Buttons (log, ln)
Trigonometry Buttons and Functionalities
Students will develop following buttons and their event listeners as part of this step:
	Sin
	Cos
	Tan
	asin
	acos
	atan
	sinh
	cosh
	tanh
Clear Button and Functionality
Students will develop following buttons and their event listeners as part of this step:
	Clear (C)

Exit Button and Functionality
Students will develop following buttons and their event listeners as part of this step:
	Exit

Grading
If your project does not compile, it receives a grade of zero.  If you do not document your program according to the documentation guidelines, the graders have been instructed to deduct up to 25%.
Step 2 (15%): Implement all the basic functionalities
